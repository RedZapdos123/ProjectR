# ProjectR: A Fish Data Analysis Toolkit üêü

## üìñ About The Project

**ProjectR** is a comprehensive data science project focused on the analysis of fish data. This repository contains a collection of scripts and a web application designed to perform exploratory data analysis, visualize datasets, and build predictive machine learning models. The core of this project is to classify fish species and predict fish weight based on their physical characteristics.

This project is broken down into several key components: a web interface (`ProjectRv1`), a data visualization script, a species classification model, and a weight prediction model.

## üèõÔ∏è Key Components

This repository is composed of several distinct parts that work together to provide a complete analysis solution.

### 1. ProjectRv1 (Web Application)

`ProjectRv1` is the user-facing web application that serves as an interactive dashboard for the machine learning models. It allows users to input fish measurements and get real-time predictions for species and weight without needing to run the Python scripts directly. It provides a user-friendly interface to the powerful models built in this project.

### 2. Fish Dataset Visualization (`fishdatasetVisualisation.py`)

Before building any models, it's crucial to understand the data. The `fishdatasetVisualisation.py` script is dedicated to **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. It uses libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to generate various plots and charts to uncover patterns, identify correlations between different physical measurements, and understand the distribution of different fish species in the dataset.

### 3. Fish Species Classifier (`fishSpeciesClassifier.py`)

The `fishSpeciesClassifier.py` script focuses on building a **machine learning classification model**. The goal is to accurately identify the species of a fish based on its measurements (like vertical, diagonal, and cross lengths; height; and width).

* **Algorithm:** This script likely implements a classification algorithm such as **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, **Random Forest**, or **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** to handle this multi-class classification problem.
* **Purpose:** The trained model can be used to automatically categorize new, unseen fish data, which is a core feature of the `ProjectRv1` web application.

### 4. Fish Weight Predictor (`fishWeightsPredictor.py`)

The `fishWeightsPredictor.py` script builds a **machine learning regression model** to predict the weight of a fish. This is a classic regression task where the model learns the relationship between the fish's physical dimensions and its weight.

* **Algorithm:** This model is likely built using a regression algorithm like **Linear Regression**, **Ridge Regression**, or a more complex ensemble method like **Gradient Boosting Regressor**.
* **Purpose:** This provides a predictive tool to estimate a fish's weight, which is another key feature integrated into the `ProjectRv1` web app.
